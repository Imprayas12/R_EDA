This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*.

```{r}

```{r}

```
```{r}
# T-value -> A larger T value indicates that it is likely that coefficient is != 0 purely by chance.
# if Pr > |t| is low then it means that if |t| value is so higher, that coefficient is significant else it is non significant.
#(Pr < 0.05) ? Reject Null hypotheses. 
```
```{r}

```
```{r}
# r^2 = 1 - RSS/TSS (Residual sum or square = (1,2,...n)/Total sum of squares)
# R Square tells us the proportion of variation in the dependent variable that has been explained by the model. 
# AIC / MAPE / MAE = ?
# Adjusted R^2 = 1 - MSE/MST , MSE = RSS/(n - q) is formulated such that it penalises the number of terms/ read - predictors in our model. So unlike R^2 , as the number of predictors in the model increases the adjusted R^2 may not always increase.

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
